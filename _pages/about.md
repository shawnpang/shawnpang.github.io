Welcome to Shawn's personal study material sharing website!

Follow me on github or favourite this website to see any upcoming updates (new notes, textbooks, and so on so forth).


Feel Free 
======
All the notes are written, uploaded, and maintained by me, so feel free to use, download, or share.
Also, contributions are greatly welcomed! 
If you want to upload your notes (preferably written in html or markdown), or you have any improvment suggestions for this site, please email them to [spang53@uwo.ca](mailto:spang53@uwo.ca)
